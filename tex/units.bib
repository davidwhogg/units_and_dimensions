	Abstract = {In ensemble methods to create multiple classifiers mostly bootstrap sampling method is preferred. The use of subsampling in ensemble creation, produce diverse members for the ensemble and induce instability for stable classifiers. In subsampling the only parameter is the subsample rate that is how much observations we will take from the training sample in each subsample. In this paper we have presented our work on the effect of different subsampling rate (SSR) in bagging type ensemble of stable classifiers, Subbagging and Double Subbagging. We have used three stable classifiers, Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Stable Linear Discriminant Analysis (SLDA) and Logistic Linear Classifier (LOGLC). We also experimented on decision tree to check whether the performance of tree classifier is influenced by different SSR. From the experiment we see that for most of the datasets, the subbagging with stable classifiers in low SSR produces better performance than bagging and single stable classifiers, also in some cases better than double subbagging. We also found an opposite relation between the performance of double subbagging and subbagging.},

@inproceedings{levine2019wasserstein,
	Abstract = {In the last couple of years, several adversarial attack methods based on different threat models have been proposed for the image classification problem. Most existing defenses consider additive threat models in which sample perturbations have bounded L_p norms. These defenses, however, can be vulnerable against adversarial attacks under non-additive threat models. An example of an attack method based on a non-additive threat model is the Wasserstein adversarial attack proposed by Wong et al. (2019), where the distance between an image and its adversarial example is determined by the Wasserstein metric ("earth-mover distance") between their normalized pixel intensities. Until now, there has been no certifiable defense against this type of attack. In this work, we propose the first defense with certified robustness against Wasserstein adversarial attacks using randomized smoothing. We develop this certificate by considering the space of possible flows between images, and representing this space such that Wasserstein distance between images is upper-bounded by L_1 distance in this flow-space. We can then apply existing randomized smoothing certificates for the L_1 metric. In MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we find that our proposed defense is also practically effective, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy under Wasserstein adversarial attack compared to unprotected models. },

	Abstract = {Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent. },

	Abstract = {Boosting is a remarkably simple and flexible classification algorithm
	with widespread applications in computer vision. However, the application
	of boosting to non-Euclidean, infinite length, and time-varying data,
	such as videos, is not straightforward. In dynamic textures, for
	example, the temporal evolution of image intensities is captured
	by a linear dynamical system, whose parameters live in a Stiefel
	manifold, which is clearly non-Euclidean. In this paper, we present
	a novel boosting method for the recognition of visual dynamical processes.
	Our key contribution is the design of weak classifiers (features)
	that are formulated as linear dynamical systems. The main advantage
	of such features is that they can be applied to infinitely long sequences
	and that they can be efficiently computed by solving a set of Sylvester
	equations. We also present an application of our method to dynamic
	texture classification.},
